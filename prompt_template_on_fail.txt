I asked you to help me write some Agda expression of specified type in previoous conversation,
and assume that we are using agda standard-library, not cubicla-agda specific definitions!

The term should be in the following context:
{placeholder1}

and it shoould be of type:
{placeholder2}

you proposed the solution:
{placeholder3}

but when I type-check that I get following error:
{placeholder4}

Can you plese try again to produce the correct solution?

Again, please respond ONLY with the term itself, without any other comments.
