I asked you to help me write some Agda expression of specified type in previoous conversation,
and assume that we are using agda standard-library, not cubicla-agda specific definitions!

term should be in following context:
{placeholder1}

and it shoould be of type:
{placeholder2}

you gave me that solution:
{placeholder3}

but when I tried to typecheck it I am getting following error:
{placeholder4}


Can you plese try to produce correct solution?
Please, respond ONLY with the term itself, without any other comment!
