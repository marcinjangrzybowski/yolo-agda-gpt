# yolo-agda-gpt

## Introduction and motivation 

The modest goal of this project is to provide a simple interface to ChatGPT for Agda.

It is aimed at proficient Agda users who wish to discharge proof obligations that are too boring or tedious to do "by hand."

This will improve the quality of life of the Agda developer, who is now free to focus on their *real* problems.

Generally speaking, this tool is not meant for beginners, since doing lots of simple things by hand in the beginning is an important part of learning the language.
